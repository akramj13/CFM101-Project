    "The function optimal_sharpe is designed to optimize the allocation of investment weights across a portfolio of stocks, aiming to achieve the highest possible Sharpe Ratio with given constraints. The Sharpe Ratio is a key financial metric that evaluates the risk-adjusted return of an investment portfolio, helping us to identify the best balance between risk and reward as we are looking to beat the market in the long run, and not necessarily on a seasonal basis or on the merit of pure luck. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function incorporates realistic constraints, such as trading fees, weight limits for each stock and a required beta constraint. It enforces the requirement that the sum of all stock weights equals one, ensuring full allocation of the investment capital, and to do this we allow fractional shares. Additionally, it sets bounds for each stock‚Äôs weight, allowing for a minimum weight to ensure diversification and a maximum weight to prevent excessive exposure to a single stock. The portfolio‚Äôs beta range must also be greater than 1 to ensure higher volatility than the market (i.e. arithmetic average percentage change in returns of S&P 500 and TSX). This implies that the inherent risk/return will be greater than the market by a certain margin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, to optimize the weightings of each stock to maximize the Sharpe ratio, the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) optimization method from the scipy.optimize.minimize function is used from the SciPy Python library. The algorithm iteratively refines the weight allocation over a large number of efficient runs. It starts with an initial guess of equal weights and algorithmically adjusts them to minimize the negative Sharpe Ratio (i.e. which maximizes positive Sharpe Ratio). The result is a set of optimized weights that dictate the ideal allocation for each stock in the portfolio. Additionally, we output a negative Sharpe Ratio, which after taking the absolute value of, we are left with the true Sharpe Ratio for a given set of assets. "

    "Through the above optimizations of a ranking system, we create the following portfolio. The portfolio accounts for any necessary fees and gives a sentiment analysis through the PCR strategy and via the standard deviations of the returns we conclude a final ranking of stocks. Then we iteratively calculate the Sharpe Ratio and Beta values of the top twelve stocks all the way up to the top 24 and take the highest Sharpe Ratio while still ensuring that the Beta of the given portfolio is above one. Through this approach, we give ourselves a relatively safe portfolio that is most likely to move in an upward trend, and then by calculating and constraining the portfolio beta compared to the market, we ensure that the portfolio can generate more returns than the market. Through this strategy, the portfolio given is extremely safe and can generate returns greater than the market. It should be duly noted that the idea that a beta greater than one does not necessarily guarantee that the portfolio performs better in the positive direction, as by taking on a greater return, we simultaneously take more risk, and hence, our portfolio still has a chance to do worse than the market. However, through the sentiment analysis we hope that a general consensus of an upward trend, may result in a consensus that our portfolio will perform with an upward trend as well.  "
